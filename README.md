Set a **Custom Prefix** System for your **Discord.JS** bot Using **MongoDB Database**!



## 📕 Requirements

- DISCORD.JS v13
- Basic understanding of how databases works
- Installing an NPM package called mongoose 

> To install it, you just have to simply do:

```js

npm install mongoose

```

## 📗 How to use?

**This repository is fully developed and Includes a whole discord bot!**



If you're looking for the command itself, Navigate through `commands/setprefix.js` and then get the code included inside of the `module.exports.run` & do the same thing for the model's folder but this time, navigate trough `models/prefix.js`!

> Make sure to know how to connect to the database or at least have some basic understanding of MongoDBplus make sure to have the model

- You can also clone this repository if you want and just replace the token in index.js

- The system for the arg also is included inside of the message event in Index.js

- make sure the message event have a similar idea to mine, or you will get some prefix errors :/

- MAKE SURE TO Set the MongoDB URL in index.js
